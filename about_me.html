    <h1>Description about me </h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Juliana Ceron but my relatives call me Juli. I'm from Cali, Colombia but I move to New York City almost six years ago. I'm 25 years old and currently finishing my Digital Marketing Associates Degree at BMCC.</p>
        
    <p>I am obsessed with flowers and animals, they have a big space in my heart. However, my biggest passion is the photography, I really enjoy take pictures of everything surround me, I can find magic on simple details in our routine moments. 
        
    I also like to travel a lot, watch the sunset from different spots and change my hair color.

    Here are some pictures that I want to share with you.

    <h5>Traveling</h5>
    <p>Vacations in my favority country, Colombia has a lot of wonderful places, one of them are Salento in Quindio, even Disney based the movie Encanto in this magic village:</p>
